# Your Planet: Too Big
Ludum Dare 38 Compo entry

> *The alien council has determined your planet is too big!*

> Nothing against you or your fellow humans, you know, the aliens pretty much think all planets are too big. Lucky for you, they see your potential! They take you with them before pummeling Earth into a (reasonably small) lump of asteroid. You've been promoted to intern space junker, so you can help them in their insane quest for smaller worlds across the galaxy! ... yay!

### Details
This is a twist on the game of Collapse, with central gravity. Click on any part of the planet to demolish it **and any connected matching terrain**. You must reduce the planet to four parts or fewer to pass the level. There are ten regular levels, and then random levels thereafter. Some of the random levels can be super hard. It's random. :)

**Spacebar:** Continue to next level or restart current level.  
**Right square bracket:** Skip level, you little cheat.

### Late Bug Fixes
:heavy_check_mark: Ding volume is supposed to be lower, instead of irritatingly loud  
:heavy_check_mark: Tracker bar highlights get messed up if you start next level before pointer completes movement  
:heavy_check_mark: Replaying a random mission (level 10+) should reset the original level, not re-randomize  
:heavy_check_mark: Bombs get misaligned when switching to fullscreen
